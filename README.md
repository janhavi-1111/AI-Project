# 1.PROBLEM STATEMENT
This idea proposes a system identifying hand movements and translating them to spoken words, where soldiers on battlegrounds may readily converse with one another. We utilise computational vision, Haar cascade classifiers, CNN, MediaPipe and other approaches for thought patterns through results. There are three techniques in this process: firstly, hand identification system that provides borders around the hand placed to another screen fixing image magnification using OpenCV and Matplot; following with a hand-held skeleton-projected connection model using MediaPipe's mapping system libraries in real-time capturing at 30 fps; lastly, sound element being introduced in each class improving recognition of the gestures.

 # 3. Conclusion
Our suggested approach shows that MediaPipe may be used as an effective tool to identify complicated hand gestures accurately, with an accuracy of 99 percent across the Military Hand Gestures utilising MediaPipe's technology and analytics. The training time required for a model is minimal. As the amount of processing power and adaptability to smart devices cuts down on the costs, the approach is more durable and cost-effective. One thing that is not often discussed, however, is the possibility of training and testing with diverse hand gesture recognition datasets. Doing so demonstrates that this framework can be implemented successfully for any hand sign language dataset, with the highest accuracy possible. Its faster real-time detection allows the model to show its efficiency better than other methods now available. This study still has to go through a number of more iterations before it becomes something people can use, but at least it opens the door to a new and more accessible method to detect hand movements. 
In conclusion, our proposed model is well tuned to be utilised for gesture detection as well as real-time picture acquisition, and this model also works with higher frames per second. This research can be advanced in a number of different ways, and the AI and database that were utilised in this study can be optimised for better results. One of the biggest difficulties we may encounter is the additional motions which are included into more gestures, which might be helpful to the issue in real-time.
# 4. Future Scope
Some distinguishing characteristics may be employed in future studies so that comparable motions may be identified with low failure rates. Attention-based Classification algorithms, in which particular areas of gestures are given greater importance for accurate prediction. The technology in the future would contemplate employing a superior camera and working with a LiDAR sensor or a 3D camera to better comprehend a hand position. In scanning and comprehending the whole categorization we aim to employ the entire hand. We aim to research night mode, in which distance characteristics from the picture taken may be understood so that illumination and the grouped background problems in the gesture detection process are not confined to the system.
